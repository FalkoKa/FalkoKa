### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Feel free to check out my repositories. Please keep in mind that some of them are just from when I started stepping into the world of software development (e.g. my calculator app, rock-paper-scissors, landinpage or the odin-signup-form). I kept those projects public as momories for when I started!

Some other projects are done during my coding bootcamp at General Assembly Sydney that I just completed in May 2023 - what a great experience! ðŸ”­

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NextJS, keep improving ReactJS and thinking about Typescript. Any other suggestions?

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m now looking for any openings for projects and/or opportunities as a junior developer! You can easily get in touch with me through LinkedIn or email!



### About ME ðŸ˜„

Before I got into coding, I was studying law in Germany and an MBA at RMIT in Vietnam (it is an Austrialian University though - long story!). Why the career change? I love new challenges and felt that my values have better alignment in this industry than in the business and legal field. 

Facts about me: 
- I am very much into details, can even be OCD about it, following conventions... hope that is not a problem!

- I am passionate about trading (US government bonds futures), but I treat that only as a hobby nowadays >)).
