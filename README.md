### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Feel free to check out my repositories. Please keep in mind that some of them are just from when I started stepping into the world of software development (e.g. my calculator app, rock-paper-scissors, landingpage or the odin-signup-form). I kept those projects public as memories for when I started!

Some other projects are done during a coding bootcamp at General Assembly Sydney that I completed in May 2023 - what a great experience! ðŸ”­

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Blockchain and Solidity. Super interesting!!

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for any 100% remote openings for projects and/or opportunities as a junior developer! You can easily get in touch with me through my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/falko-kammel/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://falko-kammel.dev/" target="_blank">Portfolio</a> or email!

### About ME ðŸ˜„

Before I got into coding, I was studying law in Germany and an MBA at RMIT in Vietnam (it is an Austrialian University though). Why the career change? I love new challenges and felt that my values have better alignment in this industry than in the business and legal field. 

Facts about me: 
- I am very much into details, can even be OCD about following certain conventions, etc... hope that is not a problem!
- I am passionate about trading (US government bonds futures), but I treat that only as a hobby nowadays >)).
